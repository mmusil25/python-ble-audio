# Model Compatibility Guide

## Understanding the Gemma .task File

The `gemma-3n-E2B-it-int4.task` file you extracted contains a model designed specifically for **MediaPipe's LLM Inference runtime**, which is currently in limited release and not publicly available.

### What's in the .task file:
- `TF_LITE_PREFILL_DECODE` - The main decoder model (1.5GB)
- `TOKENIZER_MODEL` - Tokenizer data
- `TF_LITE_EMBEDDER` - Embedding model
- Other components for multimodal processing

### Why it doesn't work:
1. The model uses advanced operations (FULLY_CONNECTED v12) designed for MediaPipe's specialized runtime
2. MediaPipe LLM/GenAI libraries are not yet publicly available
3. The model is too complex for standard mobile TensorFlow Lite

## Your Options

### Option 1: Use Demo Mode (Recommended for Testing)
The app works perfectly in demo mode:
- ✅ Audio recording works
- ✅ Speech-to-text transcription works
- ✅ Mock JSON extraction demonstrates the pipeline
- ✅ All UI features functional

### Option 2: Download a Mobile-Compatible Model
Visit Kaggle and download a mobile-optimized model:
1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma/tfLite
2. Look for models labeled:
   - "Mobile optimized"
   - "Edge TPU compatible"
   - "Quantized for mobile"
3. Download models under 500MB for best performance

### Option 3: Use Alternative Models
Consider these mobile-friendly alternatives:
- **MobileBERT** - Excellent for intent classification
- **DistilBERT** - Good balance of size and performance
- **TinyBERT** - Very small, fast inference

### Option 4: Wait for MediaPipe LLM
Google is expected to release MediaPipe LLM publicly soon. When available:
- The .task file will work directly
- No conversion needed
- Optimal performance on Pixel devices

## Technical Details

### Model Requirements for Mobile:
- **Size**: Preferably under 500MB
- **Operations**: Must use TFLite-supported ops
- **Quantization**: INT8 or INT4 for efficiency
- **Architecture**: Mobile-optimized architecture

### Current App Capabilities:
- TensorFlow Lite 2.16.1 (latest version)
- CPU inference with 4 threads
- Support for standard TFLite models
- Efficient memory management

## Recommended Action

For now, **use the app in demo mode** to:
1. Test the audio pipeline
2. Verify speech recognition works
3. See the UI and user flow
4. Understand how the app will work with a real model

When you need real inference, download a mobile-optimized Gemma variant from Kaggle or use an alternative model.

## Future Updates

When MediaPipe LLM becomes publicly available, we can update the app to use the .task file directly. This will provide:
- Optimal performance
- Full Gemma capabilities
- Seamless integration
